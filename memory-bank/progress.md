# Progress â€“ Only Task Manager

## What Works

- **Core Architecture:** Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime), Vite setup complete.
- **State Management:** Pinia stores for projects, tasks, and authentication implemented. Auth store manages user state via Supabase listener. **Data stores now reactively manage subscriptions/data based on subsequent auth state changes.** **`taskStore` includes separate state/action for reliable dashboard counts.**
- **Real-time Sync:** Supabase Realtime subscriptions implemented in stores for automatic data updates for projects and tasks. **Subscriptions are now managed reactively based on auth state. `projectStore` includes logic to attempt re-subscription on `CLOSED` or `TIMED_OUT` events.** **Real-time `DELETE` events for projects now function correctly after setting `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on the `projects` table.**
- **Routing & Navigation:** Core views (Dashboard, ProjectList) exist and are routable. Basic navigation links and fade transitions implemented. Navigation guard adjusted to wait for auth state loading. Project Details view replaced by a modal. **Basic CSS fade page transitions are implemented in `App.vue`.**
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Projects: Create (via `AddProjectModal`), Read (real-time), Delete implemented via UI using Supabase.
  - Tasks: Create (via `AddTaskModal`), Read (real-time for selected project), Delete, Update Status implemented via UI using Supabase.
- **Componentization & Composables:** Reusable components (`ProjectCard`, `TaskCard`, `BaseModal`, `AuthModal`, `ProjectDetailHeader`, `TaskList`, `AddProjectModal`, `EditTaskModal`, `StatCard`) created. `ProjectDetailModal` and `DashboardView` decomposed. Reusable form logic extracted into composables (`useTaskForm`, `useProjectForm`).
- **Styling:** Theme updated to use a static dark pink/purple gradient background with an animated CSS "searchlight" effect. CSS variables adjusted for contrast. Styles applied across components.
- **Animations:** List add/remove animations (`<TransitionGroup>`) and feedback animations (GSAP for add project/task, status change) implemented. Microinteractions (hover, click, focus) added. **Modal background blur effect implemented and fixed to persist while open.** CSS animation added for background searchlight. **Modal exit animation is smooth.** **Simple fade-in animation re-introduced for modal entrance using GSAP in the `@enter` hook.** **Implemented `prefers-reduced-motion` checks for page transitions and modal animations.**
- **Authentication:** Supabase Authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth) is implemented. Users can sign up, log in, and log out. Auth state is managed by the auth store. **AuthModal layout adjusted and close button conditionally hidden.** **Authentication flow is reliable.**
- **Database Schema & Security:** Supabase database schema for `projects` and `tasks` is defined, Realtime is enabled, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies are implemented to secure user data.
- **Dashboard:** Basic statistics (Total Projects, Tasks To Do count) implemented. **Data loads automatically after login, and counters remain accurate across navigation and page refreshes.**
- **Project Detail Modal Layout:** **Resolved Project Detail Modal height and bottom gap issues, ensuring it extends correctly to the bottom of the viewport with a slight gap above the menu button.**
- **Task Card Grid:** **Implemented task display as rectangular cards in a responsive grid within the Project Detail Modal.**
- **Add Task Modal Styling:** **Styled the Add New Task modal (size, form elements, header, buttons) to match project visual identity.**
- **Menu Button Positioning:** **Ensured the menu button floats correctly above the modal with appropriate z-index.**
- **Project Detail Modal Footer:** **Removed the "Close" button from the Project Detail Modal footer.**
- **Build Optimization:**
  - Analyzed production bundle using `rollup-plugin-visualizer`.
  - Implemented PurgeCSS via `vite-plugin-purgecss` to remove unused CSS.
  - Refactored GSAP imports to be consistently dynamic across all components, improving code splitting.

## What's Left to Build

- **Edit Functionality:** UI (forms/modals) for editing existing projects and task details. (High Priority)
- **Phase 4 UI/UX Polish & Accessibility:**
  - Perform Accessibility Review (contrast, focus, ARIA). (High Priority)
  - Performance Testing (Lighthouse on preview build). (Medium Priority)
- **Testing:** Begin comprehensive functional testing (unit, integration, E2E, cross-browser - Safari focus). (Medium Priority)
- **Advanced Animations & UX:**
  - Drag-and-drop interface for task status changes.
  - Further integration of GSAP / @vueuse/motion for more sophisticated animations (e.g., physics-based effects).
- **UI/UX Polish:**
  - Continued refinement of the "game-like" aesthetic across remaining components.
  - Implementing unique layout ideas.
  - Ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
- **Dashboard:** Add more meaningful statistics (e.g., task counts by status).
- **Task Details View:** Flesh out the placeholder view (`TaskDetailsView.vue`) if needed.
- **Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline setup (Vercel/Netlify).
- **Documentation:** Code comments, component/store documentation (beyond Memory Bank).

## Current Status

- Core architecture and Supabase integration are functional.
- Authentication and data management (CRUD, Realtime, RLS) are implemented using Supabase.
- Adding projects (`AddProjectModal`) and tasks (`AddTaskModal`) via refactored modals using composables is functional.
- Significant UI/UX refinement phase completed (styling, microinteractions, feedback animations).
- **Refactoring Complete:** Key components (`ProjectDetailModal`, `ProjectListView`, `DashboardView`) and form logic (`useTaskForm`, `useProjectForm`) refactored for better structure and maintainability.
- Dashboard statistics partially implemented and refactored (`StatCard`); **counters are reliable across navigation and refresh.**
- **Project Detail Modal layout, including height, gap, background blur, task card grid, and footer, is complete.**
- **Add Task Modal styling and size are complete.**
- **Menu button positioning relative to the modal is correct.**
- **Data stores now reactively manage subscriptions/data based on subsequent authentication state changes; dashboard updates automatically after login.**
- **Build optimization steps (PurgeCSS, dynamic GSAP imports) completed.**
- **Theme updated with static gradient background and animated searchlight effect.**
- **Modal blur effect and AuthModal layout issues are resolved.**
- **Successfully re-implemented smooth CSS fade page transitions and GSAP fade-in/out modal animations.**
- **Implemented prefers-reduced-motion checks for page transitions and modal animations.**
- Focus shifts to **Phase 4 UI/UX Polish & Accessibility** (remaining accessibility checks and performance testing).

## Known Issues

- Minor ESLint warnings may remain.
- Accessibility needs dedicated testing and optimization (beyond prefers-reduced-motion).
- Performance testing on the optimized build is pending.
- The removal of anonymous authentication means users must explicitly sign up or log in.
