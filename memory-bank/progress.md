# Progress â€“ Only Task Manager

## What Works

- **Core Architecture:** Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, Neon Auth (Beta), Neon PostgreSQL, Vite setup complete
- **Authentication:** Neon Auth (Beta) with Stack Auth SDK implemented for email/password and Google OAuth
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL with PostgREST API client configured for production
- **State Management:** Pinia stores implemented with Neon Auth integration
- **Real-time Features:** Polling-based system implemented (projects: 5s intervals, tasks: 3s intervals)
- **UI/UX Polish:** Enhanced animations (GSAP Flip, feedback), modal styling with background blur, task display as cards
- **Build Optimization:** PurgeCSS, dynamic GSAP imports, bundle analysis completed
- **Deployment Ready:** Configured for Vercel with Neon database connection

## What's Left to Build

- **Store Updates:** Update `projectStore.ts` and `taskStore.ts` to use Neon PostgREST client
- **Database Schema:** Create projects and tasks tables in Neon with RLS policies
- **Data Migration:** Transfer existing user data from Supabase to Neon
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing with new Neon infrastructure
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor polling performance and optimize if needed

## Current Status

- **Major Migration Complete:** Successfully migrated from Supabase to Neon Auth (Beta) + Neon Database
- **Authentication Working:** Neon Auth integrated with Stack SDK, maintains same user experience
- **Database Client Updated:** PostgREST client configured for Neon, removed Supabase dependency
- **Real-time Replaced:** Polling system implemented as WebSocket alternative
- **Infrastructure Ready:** Environment variables configured for Vercel deployment
- **User Migration Script:** Created for importing users with password preservation

## Known Issues

- **Store Updates Pending:** Pinia stores still reference old Supabase client
- **Database Schema:** Neon database needs table creation and RLS setup
- **Data Migration:** Existing user/project data needs migration from Supabase
- **Real-time Delay:** 3-5 second polling delays vs instant WebSocket updates
- **Beta Status:** Neon Auth is in beta, potential for breaking changes
