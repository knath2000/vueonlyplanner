# Only Task Manager â€“ Project Brief

## Project Overview

Only Task Manager is a feature-rich, visually engaging project and task management web application. It is designed for software developers and visually-oriented users who seek a playful, game-like experience for managing projects and tasks. The application is optimized for Safari on iOS and macOS, with a focus on delivering a highly unique, colorful, and animated UI/UX that stands apart from standard macOS/iOS conventions. **Recent enhancements to modal styling, including an animated background blur and task display as interactive cards, further enhance the visual engagement and game-like feel.**

## Objectives
